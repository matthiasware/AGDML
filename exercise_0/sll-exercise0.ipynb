    "# Exercise 0 - Ordinary Least Squares\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise is about linear models.\n",
    "The given data set contains prices and other attributes of approximately 54,000 diamonds. You should fit a linear model to predict the price of a diamond, given its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is meant to get you started with the tool stack. We use the following python packages:\n",
    "- pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "- numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)\n",
    "- matplotlib (https://www.matplotlib.org) and seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org)\n",
    "- sklearn (http://scikit-learn.org/)\n",

    "- color: diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)\n",
